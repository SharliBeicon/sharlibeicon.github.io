## Technical summary

- Site built with [Lume](https://lume.land/), static site generator for [Deno](https://deno.com/).

  - I wanted a static site for my portfolio to keep it simple and avoid the overhead of the trillions of web frameworks out there.
  - Supports Markdown and [Vento](https://vento.js.org/) out of the box, my two preferred template systems.
  - Deno is everything Node is, but orders of magnitude better.
  - It's a Spanish product, so there's a patriotic component too.

- Styled with Tailwind

- Hosted in [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

### Playground

_(Section under construction)_

This is a WIP of a mini-game embedded into the site. It's written in [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) and cross-compiled to WASM with [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).
