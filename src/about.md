# About

My name is Carlos, a thirty-something software engineer from southern Spain. I've been playing with tech for as long as I can remember. Like any self-respecting 90s kid, it all started with a Game Boy and a cartridge of PokÃ©mon Blue. After that, when the internet arrived at my home, everything changed. I dove into this new world with the eyes of a full-grown neckbeard trapped in a 12-year-oldâ€™s body. I started reading, participating in hacking forums, and learning the basics of programming. So I had decided from a very young age that I wanted to study a Computer Science degree.

## Journey

As expected, I studied a Computer Engineering Degree in [Universidad de CÃ¡diz](https://esingenieria.uca.es/). Nevertheless, I never limited my learning to just academics. Before, during, and after my degree, I've always been messing around with new technologies, frameworks, and the latest trends in development and electronics. Thatâ€™s why most of my side projects are built with modern languages I donâ€™t usually work with in my day-to-day job. _(until I started to work in [Databeacon](https://databeacon.aero), one of the few companies in Spain that builds their core systems in Rust ðŸ¦€)_.

## Gaming

Before adult life hit me, I was a hardcore competitive gamer, with my soul split in two halves: _Counter Strike_ and _World of Warcraft_. But, In this new stage of my life, starting from when I began working and adopted two dogs, all the way until the day I die, I became a casual console player, enjoying good stories, new JRPGs and _soulslikes_.

## Music

I'm also a music nerdge and vinyl collector. Collection you can check out in the [Vinyls section](/vinyl). I'm mostly into:

- Hip hop
- Funk
- Soul
- Jazz Fusion
- Any esoteric subgenre made between 1970 and 1985

## Other

I like keyboards and coffee.
