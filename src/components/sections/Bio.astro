    <p>
      Hello there! My name is Carlos Tocino (Charlie Bacon for non-Spanish
      speakers). I've been in the software engineering industry for <b>+6</b> years,
      delivering products and leading teams effectively. However, I've been building
      stuff (software and not software) for +13 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am graduated in computer engineering from Universidad de CÃ¡diz,
      Co-Founder of <a href="https://cenware.net" target="_blank">Cenware</a>,
      an association that helps small businesses to achieve a successful digital
      transformation, and I'm currently working at
      <a href="https://www.payretailers.com/" target="_blank">PayRetailers</a> as
      a Senior Software Engineer, processing payments across all Latin America.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also vinyl collector (check my <a
        href="https://www.discogs.com/es/user/SharliBeicon/collection"
        target="_blank">discogs</a
      >!), lifelong gamer, meme lover and, in short, a geek.
